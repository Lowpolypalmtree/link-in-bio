Typical link in bio page that redirects to my social media profiles. It was built using HTML + CSS, with the background in <a href="https://www.vantajs.com/">Vanta.js</a> (go check it out, it's amazing).

You can fork this project and create your own link-in-bio/link-tree page, with your own links, profile picture and modifications without notifying me. Credit would be nice though :)
